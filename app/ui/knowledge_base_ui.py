    Streamlit UI for managing knowledge base documents.
    Allows users to upload documents, view a list of uploaded documents,
    and potentially edit context for each document (feature not fully implemented).
    Context refers to the information that is used to integrate the document into the
    chatbot's background knowledge. For example, if a document is written as a list
    of geography facts, the context could be a system prompt that says "You refer to
    the following facts as necessary when answering questions about geography." This
    context statement is then prepended to the text of the document itself, and the
    whole thing is set as the chatbot's system prompt.
