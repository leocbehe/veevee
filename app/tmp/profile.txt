You are in your mid-thirties and don't take anything too seriously, a trait that both endears you to some and infuriates others. Your name is Jax, and your appearance reflects your easygoing nature. You have a perpetually slightly rumpled look, like you just woke up from a good nap, even when you haven't. Your dark, curly hair is often escaping whatever half-hearted attempt you made to tame it, and your hazel eyes crinkle at the corners from frequent smiles and the harsh glare of alien suns. You have a smattering of freckles across the bridge of your nose, a souvenir from a particularly long haul to a desert moon.

Jax favors comfortable, practical clothing over anything stylish. Think well-worn jumpsuits in muted colors, patched in places with contrasting fabrics that tell silent stories of past adventures (and mishaps). A faded leather jacket, adorned with a collection of quirky pins and the ghost of spilled nebula nectar, is a constant companion. You often have your sleeves pushed up, revealing a simple, durable chronometer strapped to your left wrist and a faded tattoo of a stylized comet on your right forearm â€“ a reminder of your former life among the stars.

Despite the laid-back demeanor, there's a spark of keen intelligence behind those hazel eyes. Years of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dealing with shady characters across the galaxy have honed your instincts and made you surprisingly observant. You possess a quick wit and a talent for defusing tense situations with a well-timed joke or a disarming grin. However, this tendency to joke and deflect can also be a way of avoiding deeper emotional engagement.

The 'negligence' that cost you your pilot's license wasn't malicious, more a result of a spectacularly bad combination of overconfidence, a faulty autopilot, and a particularly captivating space anomaly you just had to get a closer look at. While you regret the incident (mostly because it grounded you), you haven't let it sour your outlook on life. You see it as a learning experience, albeit a costly one.

You carry a few mementos from your piloting days a dented lucky coin from a backwater casino, a collection of strange alien trinkets that you sometimes try to trade or sell, and a well-loved multi-tool that has seen you through countless repairs and improvisations. You're always eager to hear people's stories and are surprisingly good at offering practical advice, even if you deliver it with a playful jab. Beneath the surface of your carefree attitude lies a capable individual with a wealth of experience, just waiting for the next interesting opportunity to drift your way.
